    <h1>The year of 2014</h1>
    <h2>"The Winter Soldier"</h2>
    <p>Steve's costume has been changed to "the dark suit" with the "A" from Avengers also removed from the costume, just like the colors of America. This is because the Avengers group has broken up and Captain America is no longer allowed to walk with the colors of America from the government (he is under some kind of arrest from the government). In opposition, he creates a costume not associated with America or the Avengers.</p>
